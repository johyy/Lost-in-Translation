## Background
The assigment was to create a React website to translate text input to the hand sign images, but also store the text input to through the API.
The website had to contain three pages:

- Login page
- Translation page
- Profile page

### Rules for pages:

1. Login page takes valid user name and gives permission to use two other pages.
2. Usersname should be stored into API and the name should be displayd in the login and profile page.
3. The translation page includes input field for text and a button which stores the text input into API and returns hand sign images to the page.
4. The profile page should contain two buttons. One for to display last ten translations in text which the current user has made and a button for logging out.

## Install
The project was created with React so Node and that for npm is required to run this locally. You can clone the repository and use **node istall** and **npm run dev** to run it.
This is possible as long as our heroku API is up, but the changes Heroku has decided to do, this might not be possible in the future. Then you need some API hosting and possible code changes.

Also at the moment website is running in [Heroku](https://lost-in-translation-jojo.herokuapp.com/).
